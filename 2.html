    <h2>CSS</h2>

    <a href="https://namu.wiki/w/CSS" target="_blank" titel="What is CSS?">Cascading Style Sheet(CSS)</a> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
    This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
    .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br><br>

    <p style="margin-top : 45px">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page
    in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, <br>by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. <br>CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
